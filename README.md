# AmazonSES Sendmail

AmazonSES Sendmail is a language-agnostic, non-blocking (async) sendmail library to use with Amazon SES.

Uses [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org) for HTTP API and [Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) for lightweight concurrency.

With Gevent green-threads we don't waste our time waiting for a reply from Amazon SES API before send the next message. Each worker runs on it own pseudo-thread, without locks. All messages received by this library will be included on a Queue, while all workers catch each message and send it independently.

There's only one lock that can happen if your OUTBOX is full. In this case, you probably need to raise up the number of WORKERS or the OUTBOX_MAXSIZE in config.py file.

Please note that all messages in OUTBOX are stored in memory. If your messages are big and your outbox are accepting a large number of messages, you can run out of memory. In future this library will support persistence to avoid problems with huge queues.

This library has been used in production to send more than half million messages per day. If you have a high send rate limit on your Amazon SES account, you can easily send thousands of emails per minute.


### Requirements

* gevent
* cjson (optional but recommended).
* bottle and amazon_ses are already included in lib/ folder.


### Usage

1. Insert your AmazonSES access key in config.py
2. Start the server:  python start.py
3. Send your emails (see Python client example below)

If you just want to do some tests, you can access the [/add url](http://localhost:3000/add/?from=your@email.com&to=another@email.com&subject=subject&text=message+text
) in your browser. Just change the params (from, to, subject, text) and the email will be sent.


### Configure

The config.py file has (at this time) just a few options to configure:

* AMAZON_KEY and AMAZON_SECRET: your Amazon ID and Secret;
* HOST and PORT: default host and port to listen;
* WORKERS: number of workers to run in parallel;
* OUTBOX_MAXSIZE: the number of messages that can be stored in outbox.

Read comments at config.py file for more details.


### Features

* [/add](http://localhost:3000/add) - Add message to outbox.
* [/status](http://localhost:3000/status) - Return how much emails are queued, sent, errors and how much messages are in outbox.
* [/quota](http://localhost:3000/quota) - Return your Amazon SES quota (max-24h-send, sent-last-24h and max-send-rate)
* [/statistics](http://localhost:3000/statistics) - Return your Amazon SES usage statistics.
* [/verify](http://localhost:3000/verify) - Return your verified email address (by Amazon).
* [/verify/add](http://localhost:3000/verify/add) - Verify email address. Send the email as param. [example](http://localhost:3000/verify/add?email=xxx@xxx.com).
* [/verify/del](http://localhost:3000/verify/del) - Unverify email address. Send the email as param. [example] (http://localhost:3000/verify/del?email=xxx@xxx.com).
* All logs are written on logs/worker.log file. (Exceptions, errors and sent emails).
* All API responses are in json format.
* All API requests can be made in GET and POST methods.


### Python client example

    import urllib, urllib2, json

    URL = 'http://localhost:3000/add'

    # message data
    data = {
        'from': 'some@email.com',
        'to:' 'another@email.com',
        'subject': 'Hello dude',
        'text': 'AmazonSES test.',
        'html': '<b>AmazonSES</b> test.',
    }

    # if you need specific headers:
    headers = {'return-path': 'thatsme@email.com',}
    data['headers'] = json.dumps(headers)

    # encode the POST data
    encoded_data = urllib.urlencode(data)

    # make the request
    request = urllib2.Request(URL, encoded_data)
    response = urllib2.urlopen(request).read()

    # unserialize the json response
    response_data = json.loads(response)

    # print response
    print response_data['status']
    print response_data['message']


### Know issues

* AmazonSES has some [sending limits](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/#details): the sending quota and maximum send rate. At this moment this library doesn't care about it and presumes that you have large limits and a good reputation in AmazonSES. At this time we have only one workaround. To control how much emails per second will be sent you can just adjust the number of workers at config.py file. It's not precise, but works.


### Todo

* Treat AmazonException's generated by sending limits. Maybe re-add messages in queue and automaticaly decrease the sending rate.
* Create some persistence to store messages when outbox is full.
* Correct my english mistakes in this README and in project comments :)
